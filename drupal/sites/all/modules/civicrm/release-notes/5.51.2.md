* **_DOMPDF_: Upgrade to 2.0 ([#24038](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/24038))**

  This applies a prophylactic security update. It is not believed to impact the security of CiviCRM deployments.

* **_Scheduled Reminders_: Some tokens defined by extensions may not evaluate ([#24115](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/24115))**
* **_Upgrader_: Show additional notice about running extension upgrades ([#24040](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/24040))**
