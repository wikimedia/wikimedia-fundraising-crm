<p>Dear {{contact.first_name}},</p>
<p>You are amazing, thank you so much for donating to the Wikimedia Foundation! </p>
<p>This is how we pay our bills -- it's people like you, giving five dollars, twenty dollars, a hundred dollars. My favourite donation last year was five pounds from a little girl in England, who had persuaded her parents to let her donate her allowance. It's people like you, joining with that girl, who make it possible for Wikipedia to continue providing free, easy access to unbiased information, for everyone around the world. For everyone who helps pay for it, and for those who can't afford to help. Thank you so much.</p>
<p>I know it's easy to ignore our appeals, and I'm glad that you didn't. From me, and from the tens of thousands of volunteers who write Wikipedia: thank you for helping us make the world a better place. We will use your money carefully, and I thank you for your trust in us.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Sue Gardner<br />
Wikimedia Foundation Executive Director</p>
