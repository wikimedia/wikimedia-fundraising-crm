<p>Dear {contact.first_name},</p>
<p>I’m sorry to interrupt you once more. This is a final reminder that the last payment of your {contribution_recur.amount} {$txtFrequency} gift to the Wikimedia Foundation could not be processed on {contribution_recur.next_sched_contribution_date}.</p>

<p>Life moves quickly, and it's easy to forget to update payment information when a debit or credit card has changed or expired. If this is the case, <a target="_blank" href='https://donate.wikimedia.org?wmf_medium=civi-mail&wmf_source=FY2526_FailedRecur_2&wmf_campaign=FailedRecur&frequency={$txtFrequency}'> you can quickly restart your {$txtFrequency} donation with your new payment information. </a></p>

<p>If supporting Wikipedia at the {$txtFrequency} level no longer fits your budget, consider a new recurring donation at a lower amount or making a one-time donation instead. What matters is your support, not the amount of your gift: All donations enable billions of people around the world to experience the daily gift of knowledge on Wikipedia. </p>

<p>Sincerely,<br>
Sandra M. Hust <br>
Wikimedia Donor Relations</p>
