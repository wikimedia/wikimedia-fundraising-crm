Hi {contact.first_name},

Thank you for your continued support of the Wikimedia Foundation and free knowledge. In {now.MMMM}, we were unable to process your {if '{contribution_recur.frequency_unit}' == 'month' }monthly{else}annual{/if} donation of {contribution_recur.amount} to Wikipedia.

Your support is very important to us. If you would like to renew your support for Wikipedia on {if '{contribution_recur.frequency_unit}' == 'month' }a monthly{else}an annual{/if} basis, please take one minute to start a new recurring donation, and keep Wikipedia online and ad-free.

Wikipedia exists thanks to contributions from readers like you.

Thank you again for your support of this mission.
