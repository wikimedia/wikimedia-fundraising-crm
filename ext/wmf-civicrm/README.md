# wmf-civicrm

This extension is intended as a catch-all for WMF functionality that does not fit well elsewhere.
The goal is over time to move functionality from the drupal modules and to eventually
discontinue them to facilitate our move away from Drupal 7 & reduce CMS dependence.

## Requirements

* PHP v7.0+
* CiviCRM 5.27+
